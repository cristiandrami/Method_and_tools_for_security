You must call the callme_one(), callme_two() and callme_three() functions in that order, each with the arguments 0xdeadbeef, 0xcafebabe, 0xd00df00d e.g. callme_one(0xdeadbeef, 0xcafebabe, 0xd00df00d) to print the flag. For the x86_64 binary double up those values, e.g. callme_one(0xdeadbeefdeadbeef, 0xcafebabecafebabe, 0xd00df00dd00df00d)

The solution here is simple enough, use your knowledge about what resides in the PLT to call the callme_ functions in the above order and with the correct arguments. If you're taking on the MIPS version of this challenge, don't forget about the branch delay slot.
